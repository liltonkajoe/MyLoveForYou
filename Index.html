	I love you so much my beautiful baby you are the best thing to ever happen to me I love you with all my heart and soul thank you for reassuring me every time I overthink and thank you for being there for me everything I was sad or lonely thank you for being in my life. I Love you so much and I do not understand how you could ever think poorly of yourself you are the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. You are my one and only love. I love all the names you call me I love every single last one. I wish you knew the thoughts I have about you, I wish I could explain the feeling of when I first saw your beauty. I still remember the first time we met and how the butterflies filled my stomach. When we finally were alone the entire world stopped for a moment and I finally felt at peace. That's when I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. At the end of the day, I want it to be you and me, I want your early mornings, and I want your late nights. I want you on your good days, even more on your bad. It wasn't exactly love at first sight but it was something like that. The first time we spoke I felt it, like a little electric burn. I felt my life change. Because of you.
